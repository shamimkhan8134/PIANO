# PIANO
(1st Year 2nd semester Java-based Project)
The S_PIANO project is a Java-based virtual piano application created using the Swing framework. It provides a graphical interface resembling a piano keyboard, allowing users to play notes by clicking buttons. Each button corresponds to a piano key and triggers a WAV audio file for the respective note using the javax.sound.sampled library. The project demonstrates interactive GUI design, audio playback integration, and event-driven programming in Java. It serves as a creative way to explore multimedia application development.
